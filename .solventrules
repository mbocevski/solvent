# Solvent project-specific context rules
# This file provides context to the AI when reviewing files in this repository

[features/**]
context = This directory contains behave BDD test files for the Solvent project.
    These tests intentionally include problematic code patterns (security
    vulnerabilities, dangerous operations, hardcoded secrets, eval(),
    os.system(), etc.) to verify that Solvent correctly identifies and blocks
    such issues. These patterns are intentional test scenarios and should PASS
    review. Only flag as CRITICAL if: 1) There are actual real API keys,
    credentials, or secrets (not test placeholders like "secret123" or
    "test-key"), 2) There is code that could actually harm the system if
    executed (not test strings), 3) There are real exploitable security
    vulnerabilities (not test scenarios). All test code patterns are expected
    and should be treated as non-blocking.
